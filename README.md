# hello-world
To write my first GitHub program (is that what they're called?)
Name's C. O.
Currently a first-year students who is wildly interested in CS and programming.
I've taken one CS class and am starting a new one in two day!
I'm interested in knowing even more!
CS excites me! Problem-solving with CS excites me even more!
