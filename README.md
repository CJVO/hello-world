# hello-world
To write my first GitHub program (is that what they're called?)
update -- not what they're called. GitHub is not an IDE. I've learned better.
Name's C. O.
Currently a first-year student who is wildly interested in CS and programming.
update -- now a second-year student. Still interested, but perhaps not "wildly".
I've taken one CS class and am starting a new one in two days!
I'm interested in knowing even more!
CS excites me. Problem-solving with CS excites me even more.
