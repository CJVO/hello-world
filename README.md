# hello-world
To write my first GitHub program (is that what they're called?)
Name's C. O.
Currently a first-year students who doesn't know a thing about CS and programming
Ok, I do know a few things; I've taken a CS class
I'm interested in knowing even more!
CS excites me! Problem-solving with CS excites me even more!
